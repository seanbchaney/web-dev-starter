# web-dev-starter

This is a starter project for web development with no frameworks and minimal
dependencies. It is intended to be a starting point for web development projects
that are written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have live preview installed.
2. Press F1 (may need to do FN + F1).
3. Start live preview.
4. Copy the URL given in terminal (or use this: http://127.0.0.1:3000/) and open in browser.

npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.
